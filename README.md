# dragonfly-configs
This repository contains my configs for dragonfly with the Kaldi speech engine. They are currently mac-only.

# TODO
* Find a way to unify CCR for keyboard and programming languages
* Better chained modifiers (e.g. ctrl+shift+cmd+f and such)  
* Repeat commands for most commands (like "tab last second")
* Better git command line support for more commands
